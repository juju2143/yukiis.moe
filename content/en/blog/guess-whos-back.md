Well. We're back with new comics every Tuesday in a brand new style, I guess.

Also I started posting the comics on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Patreon, the latter of which you can pay $1 a month on there to see said comics before everyone else! I never bothered to do this before as I used to always finish the week's comic on Mondays 11:58pm, like 2 minutes before it goes live on the site but nowadays I end up finishing it on Thursday or Friday instead so yeah, that might be worth it...

Also $3 lets you get spoilers for another project of mine, $5 lets you get a shoutout on the website, and I might draw you for $10! Might add other perks, but that'll do for now.

Anyway. Have fun, I guess. All the links are in the sidebar!
