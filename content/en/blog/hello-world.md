This comic was previously hosted in a separate category on [my normal blog](https://toasters.rocks) where I talk about random stuff not related with this at all, and I was bored of the default theme not adapted for a webcomic, so here it is. I moved everything to a new website. That is adapted to webcomics. With proper back and next buttons.

There's still a few bugs and kinks here and there as I write this, and the design could be improved, but eh, it should still be way better than it was before.

Anyway. Have fun.
