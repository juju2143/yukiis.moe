New chapter, new redesign. Or is it the other way around? Anyway, it's still the comic you know and love.

This comic always been about experimentation, using character creators as much as possible (along with my own drawings and photography when possible, to spice it up a bit). The first few comics used Pony Town characters in Microsoft Chat 2.5, then after a small hiatus my workflow upgraded to Adobe Illustrator and MikuMikuDance, after I experimented a bit with VRoid and the like. Then, last week, one reader told me my drawing of Yuki in the last panel kind of reminded them of Kisekae, which is another 2D character creator (which has quite a lot of NSFW options, btw), so I tried it and... Yeah, it's way better than anything else I tried before. And as mom's computer is the only thing in the house that could run MMD correctly (I definitely should upgrade my crap computer once I have some money for it), Kisekae it is. One thing is that there's no way for 3/4 poses and such, so she'll always face the camera, but this should allow for way more pose possibilities.

So yeah, I hope you enjoy :)
