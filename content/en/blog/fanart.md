I managed to add a [fanart gallery](/series/horselife-bonus/), so if you send fanart I'll put it up there? I kinda hacked the WordPress theme so it works and won't show up in the main comic archive, and it might break each time I update it, so eh, have fun. I already put most of the fanart of the Human Yuki era there, hope you like them, and be sure to support the artists!

Hey, while we're at it, let's do a fanart contest, or a draw it in your style challenge, whatever you want to call it. I have a lot of artists in my friends, and it's my birthday soon, so why not? Take this Yuki, draw her in your style, get creative and you might get featured here! Perfect if you don't know what do draw and you find Yuki attractive :)

I also added a FAQ section in the [about page](https://yukiis.moe/about/) with a bunch of guidelines for said contest, so check it out!
