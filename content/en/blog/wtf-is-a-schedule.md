This week's comic is gonna be late. Yeah, I know, I'm trying to stick to a "every Monday" schedule, but now I guess we're back to the "post whenever I want" schedule. My workflow stopped working correctly (Windows's a bitch I hate it), plus I just got a new, proper office job getting in the way (except I'm still working at home due to the pandemic thing), so it's gonna mess everything up.

So yeah, expect a comic eventually, don't know when, and when you get it, please pretend it's still June 2020. Until then, follow my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/juju2143) and other social media to get some updates and other stupid comedic one-liners.

Edit: we did it? Posted before pride month finishes, at least in my time zone. Cool.
