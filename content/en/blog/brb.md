I'm taking a break. Again. Yeah, I only managed to last 8 strips this time, but eh. Life's been hard these days, and while it made me draw more, which is a good thing, especially with season 4 of HL98 which is the first one I didn't use a character creator, as I made everything from scratch, I didn't really had time for deadlines so... yeah, I'm just going back to posting whenever, I guess.

I'm gonna use this time to work on other projects, or maybe to improve on the Horse Life 98 universe, who knows... Anyway, expect some cool stuff for season 5, maybe character arcs? Better art style? New characters? Who knows?

Anyway. I'm just doing this for fun. And my friends say it's cute. No worries here. I'll be back. Eventually.
