purple miku for no reason

also, it's one of these comics I'm publishing 2 minutes early so that the joke works, happy 13th and 15th anniversary of Hatsune Miku and the single release of "Wake Me Up When September Ends", respectively

fun fact, I once made a Miku recolor with purple hair like 10 years ago, back when I figured out how to change the colors in a picture in GIMP, that and purple Amy Rose, that was wack
