Well. This is the end. Or is it? I don't know.

I thought of this comic way back in the summer of 2021, way before Part 1. as some sort of self-reflection on my art, the creator talking to their creation, a la ending of Garfield and his nine lives. And Part 1 came in, with some sort of animation I half-assed in After Effects, where my creation died, and thought it would be a nice prequel ot that concept. And then it got way more ambitious than it should be, as the projects I've tried to start before it.

Maybe I just have to keep it simple.

Anyway. Yuki is not dead. She'll be forever.

Merci d'avoir embarqué dans mon délire.

Happy St-Bernard-Legault.
