they said no

this comic takes place and was made around [episode 20](https://yukiis.moe/comic/horselife-20/) back when she applied to a panel at Otakuthon a while ago, hence the old 3D model, but unfortunately she's been refused

I was hoping to use it as a panel announcement if it was accepted, or reuse it later for another convention otherwise, but it’s still kinda funny and there's a joke specific to this one convention so I’m still putting it up here as this week’s comic no matter what

so, this week, for your eyes only, a comic only the Otakuthon staff have seen back in June

so uh, I’m still probably gonna go as a visitor so if you see a Yuki at Otakuthon this weekend please say hi if you can I dunno how it’s gonna work in this virtual world thing
