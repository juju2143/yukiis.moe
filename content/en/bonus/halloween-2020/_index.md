Hey, while you're waiting for the hiatus to end here's a few Halloween costumes for Yuki...

First one is Reimu Hakurei from Touhou Project. You know, back when she had purple hair in the PC-98 era. She's pretty cool.

Second one is Snj√≥ri, a tiefling bard from an upcoming game of Dungeons & Dragons I'm having with a few friends I have on Discord. Gonna be fun. She have like 19 in charisma, and yes, she took up a few bra sizes.

Third one is a last minute request from my good friend Roxanne on the Frivolesque chatrooms, she requested Yuki in the cheerleader uniform from Lucky Star.

So, hope to see you soon and happy Halloween!
