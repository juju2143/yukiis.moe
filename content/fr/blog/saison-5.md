Well, welcome to Season 5 of this exciting comic that is Horse Life 98. I worked probably 2, 3 months on it, and that's only the first part. To be fair, I started with Part 2 first, and I completely wrote it before coming up with a Part 1, and trust me, this makes way more sense. And while I was at it, figured I should redo the website from scratch as well and implement some sweet subpage system instead of trying to coerce WordPress into what I want with mitigated results... You like it? I feel this, from Season 5 onwards, is going to be a huge step up from before, as I decided to take my time drawing the comic and stick to my usual style rather than finding shortcuts and copypaste assets so a comic would take 5 minutes to produce on top of a rushed idea. Which kinda worked well for motivation, but only for a time... But I guess this is going to allow me to explore more ways to tell a story with animations and stuff like that, try and experiment things. I love where it's going and I hope you'll love it as well.

So yeah. Enjoy some animated Yuki drifting into space on music by [fusoxide](https://fusoxide.github.io/fusosite/) (thanks a lot for that, fuso!) on what is possibly a love letter to one of, if not my favourite TV show from my childhood, [Dans une galaxie pr√®s de chez vous](http://dansunegalaxie.ca). (For the fans out there, this is why it was released on that particular day, with that particular music and that particular text ;)) The next few comics will be similarly ambitious and feature more pop culture references, so stay tuned!

Next comic when? I have honestly no idea. But you'll know if you check my socials.
