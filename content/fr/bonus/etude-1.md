Still no comic this week, but... have a full-sized Yuki I drew. It probably took me the better of the last 2-3 weeks... I kinda like the result here.

Anyway. It's been one year now I introduced Yuki in her anime girl form, mostly as a 420 weed joke, and she almost never looked back on her pony form again. Happy humanday, Yuki.

And yes, #1 because there's gonna be more of them. If I have the motivation for. We'll see, obviously no comic tomorrow but stay tuned!
