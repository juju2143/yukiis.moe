(keep scrolling down!)
It's been a year...
It's been a while, isn't it?
who are you?
It's me. Don't you recognize me?
...
you...
Yeah. You have died. One year ago.
That was a painful and horrible death, I must admit.
But to what end? A creative block?
For I am your creator, and you are a figment of my imagination.
I have complete control over this world and its destiny.</description></item></channel></rss>
